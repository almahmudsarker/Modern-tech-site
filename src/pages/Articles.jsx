            Ray Kurzweil projects that, by 2045, humanity will be hooked up to a
            "shared neocortex in the cloud" by brain-computer interfaces. We
            will leave the brain-computer interfaces to Elon Musk, but we
            believe it’s possible to build that "shared brain" now, and that it
            might look different than many imagine.

            We're starting by creating a notebook that augments the user's
            intelligence.
            <br />
            <br />
            We want to create a future where nobody feels alone with their
            ideas, where intellectual soulmates find each other, where
            superconnectors are empowered. We see our software as critical to
            creating the frame for humans and machines to work together to solve
            the world's most important problems.

            With a raise of $10 million and the backing of prominent
            thought-leaders in the field, we are ready to take on these
            challenges. We are looking for fearlessly creative individuals who
            can fall in love with personal information management systems with
            us – which we see as integral to the destiny of the Web.
